Exercise: Hypertext story 

Create an interactive hypertext narrative that reveals something about yourself or an experience you've had. It could be a story about yourself, a journey through a topic you're interested in, a mode of navigation that mimics your personality, etc. There should be multiple HTML pages, linked together by <a> tags. Each page could contain text and/or images. No CSS styling. Limit your focus to story and interaction.
